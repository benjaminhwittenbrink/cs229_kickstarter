      "StoryRisksEnvironmental commitmentsStoryOne of the specific challenges that we noticed was how difficult it can be to run source material stories. We made our story's design more universal for Game Masters of all levels of experience. Felbar's Shoppe of Curiosities and Occult fills that gap by:Providing a scaled experience point distribution system for levels 1-15.Providing color coded text for plot points, flavor text, encounters, geographical information, and more!Providing color coded GM's Notes between sections of the text to advise and inform the GM of story elements or experiences, our insights from game testing, or general GM strategies.Encouraging you to write in this book! The paper material was specifically chosen to work well with a pencil. Each Chapter of the story has been purposefully designed with spaces for you to take notes in the sides and underneath the monster stat blocks. (Please see our updates for images of what this looks like!) Creating battle maps that are easier to recreate and unique.Creating encounters that are designed to keep you from having to flip between books and different pages.Designing our page layouts for spaces where you, the GM, can take notes or manage your encounters on paper that is designed to be written on.The entire story is summarized in a single section of the book to give the GM an overview before running the game. This design helps the GM make changes to the original story if they'd like and keep up with NPC story arcs.Generated 40+ NPC stat blocks with character illustrations and roleplaying tactics.Provided supplement material for the Common Lands to help GM and Players get a baseline for the lore of the setting.Designing materials that can be torn from the book to be used as supplements or puzzles for a more kinesthetic experience. Visualizing key moments of the story with chapter illustrations.In April 2020, we registered our business - Common Lands Associated Media - and raised over $3,000 from friends and family through GoFundMe to get our project off the ground. Humbled by all of this support, we took two years of writing, game testing, and editing before we could reach this point and share our project with you! We have compiled a story that is compatible with 5th Edition system, with a great story, and a new take on the traditional role of campaign modules in gaming. Our mission is to write D&D gaming modules that are simple to follow and understand for entry-level and veteran tabletop gamers alike in our original world called, \"The Common Lands.\"Our vision is to create and distribute 5th Ed. and tabletop RPG content usable for anyone who plays paper and pencil games. Our product and future products will be focused on creating modules as a tool for social-emotional learning.Experience the Common Lands for free FREE!!!Download the Common Lands One-Shot Troughwater Oasis today.Free promo oneshotCheck out our review on Geeks-A-GogoCheck out our podcast - Talking In CommonThe story takes place in an original campaign setting called, The Common Lands, a home to the common folk. Our story starts off during the graveyard shift of a shipyard packaging company called, \"Copperscale Family Trade,\" a quiet business in a quiet part of the world. Adventure stirs when the trading shop is visited by Zemodeus Blackhorn, Captain of the Wolf Whistle. Awaiting him is a mysterious package that has collected years of dust, just waiting to be claimed! Zemodeus invites the players to help him on his mission to find more of these mysterious packages that lead to the elusive deliveree... Gorman Mandrake, Keeper of a Realm of Existence called The Felbar - A place where magic originates! But Zemodeus is not alone in this endeavor... Someone else has joined the race to find the Felbar only he wishes to claim its wealth of magic for himself.

Meanwhile, industry, innovation, and enlightenment took over and ushered in, “The New Ways,” changing the face of the Common Lands to where the story currently takes place. The two principles have been in eternal conflict, delicately balancing between the chaos of the land and the law of the people.The Common Lands was established in 2011 with contributions from over 30 individuals who have gamed at our tables, using this setting. Years of campaign lore have been laid out in details that will help you, the game master, get a deeper understanding of the world you are working within. Our content covers history of major events, wars, religions, political conflicts, leadership changes, and momentous events that have made the Common Lands what it is.

      "StoryRisksStoryWe're a women-run and mission-driven foodbrand handcrafting flavorful and functional condiments for everyday use. We source only organic ingredients directly from small independent farms or cooperatives all over the world blending with adaptogenic mushrooms to create our magic pantry staples.Over the first few weeks of the pandemic quarantine in New York, I began missing my favorite restaurant foods. The staples were chili oil and flavorful spices. I ordered everything that existed on the market and even looked for recipes to create my own, but nothing tasted right.After being diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), one of the most common hormone disorders in women, I became extremely health conscious. I was determined to figure out how to manage PCOS through my diet and have been hyper aware of everything I put in my body ever since. Using passion and love for food to source the highest quality ingredients, I concocted Wander Magic Sauce & Sprinkles. After many, many rounds of testing, I finally had kitchen staples that have made my mind, body, and soul, strong, healthy, and happy!All organic ingredients and single-origin, grown sustainably by small independent farms from all over the world, handcrafted in small batches in a plastic free packaging to your home. These ingredients are not just good for the planet, but good for your body.Wander’s magic sauce is savory, spicy and just a tiny bit sweet, a perfect addition to all kinds of dishes! We put it on eggs, pasta, pizza, tacos, popcorn, in soup, salad dressings, marinades, or whatever your heart desires!INGREDIENTS: organic extra virgin olive oil, organic sesame oil, organic balsamic vinegar, non-GMO liquid amino acids, water, organic chili peppers, organic ashwangandha, organic lion's mane, organic garlic, organic onion, organic spicesAdd some magic to your meals!Magic Sprinkles is composed of a nutrient-dense mix of organic medicinal mushrooms, nutritional yeast, and spices. Add a burst of umami flavor to anything you want to season- stir fry, chicken roasts, potatoes, soup stocks, you name it!INGREDIENTS: sea salt, organic nutritional yeast, organic cordyceps mushroom, organic reishi mushroom, organic garlic, organic onion, organic cayenne pepper, organic turmericThe two products can be used separately or together to layer in all the adaptogenic benefits into your dishes!A sprinkle in every dish for added flavor & health benefits!Where we are:We’ve already developed the perfect health conscious, organic, vegan blend for our oil and spice mix after lots of trial and error. We had made over 100 batches and taste tested it among friends, relatives, and roommates. Every review has noted the clean, unique flavor that has our fans mixing into all kinds of foods. After using these adaptogenic products on myself, I’ve noticed how much it has eased my anxiety and stress after changing from eating heavily processed versions. It may not cure what ails you, but it’s a seasoning you can trust to help improve your mood and diet, and I hope to share that amazing feeling with the world!What makes us different from other chili oil brands in the market?Our products are better for the people who grow our food, the people who enjoy our food, and the planet.What’s next:As a small, women run, self-funded company, we’ve tried to do everything ourselves. With the pandemic came some unexpected job loss and trying to pay for production and fulfillment costs out of pocket is close to impossible. Everything is lovingly hand-made and creating a product with the highest quality ingredients and sustainable, plastic free packaging is not the cheapest venture. We want to stay true to our values of creating food that is good for your body and the planet and we need your help to make that dream a reality. The recipe is perfected, the design is complete, but the last step of producing the product at a large scale needs that extra little push to bring us into existence.Mushrooms have been a medicinal and culinary staple in the East for thousands of years. We want to bring their adaptogenic properties to your kitchen.Here are some of Our Magic Ingredients:Organic Cobanero Chiles- Loaded with capsaicin and iron, these chiles can aid in dissolving fibrin, a substance that causes blood clots.Organic Lion’s Mane Mushrooms- Aids with brain health, especially memory and cognition used by athletes.Organic Reishi Mushrooms- Used as a sleep, stress and immunity booster.Organic Shiitake Mushrooms- Full of antioxidants, this mushroom also supports the skin and liver.Organic Cordycep Mushrooms- Helps improve energy levels as well as immunity.Organic Ashwagandha- Has been known to help the body manage stress, improve focus and mental clarity, and boost immunity.Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil- Full of anti-inflammatory properties, protects against heart disease and Alzheimer's. It is also packed with beneficial fatty acids as well as Vitamin E and Vitamin K.From Guatemala to Italy, we’ve been sourcing the very best ingredients to create the healthiest condiments. We buy from small farms like Don Amilcar’s in Cobán (pictured!) to make sure we’re paying growers a fair and living wage. TransparencyWe carefully source all ingredients that are fine dining restaurant quality and support passionate small independent farmers to create the best pantry staples and better living standards to those who grow and care for our food.Cobanero Chili, GuatemalaOur Cobanero chili is a rare Mayan variety of chili pepper, only grown in the mountains around the city of Cobán in Guatemala. It has a lush, fruity aroma and a fierce, smoky heat that makes everything taste better. Perfect for anyone who appreciates true chili flavor.Calabria Project, ItalyOur Carolea Organic extra virgin olive oil is the result of two companies working together to help small independent farmers continue to grow olives in the southern region of Italy, Calabria. Harvesting follows traditional methods and olives are milled by cold extraction in order to obtain a high quality extra virgin olive oil. From harvesting to processing, every step is carried out with care and precision. With a delicate olive taste, this oil represents the ideal organic olive oil for everyday enjoyment.Single Origin Turmeric, IndiaWith Diaspora Co's Turmeric, we are here to put money, equity and power into the hands of Indian farmers, and to disrupt and decolonize an outdated commodity spice trading system. In cutting out all middle men, we hugely increase the amount of money we can pay our partner farms. It means we are able to work with much smaller farms who in a traditional model would have lacked the capital or resources to export or scale. Our focus is on flavor, sustainability and heirloom seed, so if a farmer matches those criteria, they can rest assured that they will have a long term partner in us.Wander into the magic with us!Use of FundsWe will use the fund mainly to prepare for first commercial batch. Although we set the goal of the project to $10K to just cover base costs, we will need approximately $20K to establish smooth operations because we are just starting up.$8000 for inventory - Since we only source organic and single origin from small independent farmers from over the world. This means we need to secure a large amount of ingredients ahead of time just enough to last until the next harvesting season!$5000 for a labor of love - We’re lovingly handcrafting every single jar right here in Brooklyn, NY. We provide a fair living wage to all of our staff and we're proud of it.$3500 for an FDA approved commercial kitchen space is necessary for more efficient operations and the shortest turnaround on our orders.$3000 for Shipping Materials and fees (100% post recyclable shipping box, glass jars, plastic free packaging and print plate) - We’ve perfected our custom-made packaging to ensure maximum durability of our glass jar for nationwide delivery.YOUR REWARDS!Risks and challengesWe're a small team of creative and awesome women on a big mission, which is why we're raising $10,000 in funds on Kickstarter today.Funding will go toward renting a commercial kitchen, packaging costs (plastic-free), insurance, licenses, permits, and application fees.They will also go towards the purchase of all organic, heirloom, fair trade, and single-origin spices used by professional chefs and fine dining restaurants (which cost 2x more than your store-bought organic spices!) Yes, we use only use the best ingredients!If this campaign is successful, we'll start production in early December in the commercial kitchen. We'll aim to ship in early January, but this may be delayed due to any of the following:- Fulfillment or Shipment Delays: Certain items such as our custom boxes and packaging run the risk of long lead times due to the pandemic, in addition to USPS and UPS experiencing shipping delays. We have built-in a significant buffer to these reward timeframes, so we don't foresee this to be a problem, but we will monitor the situation and keep our backers posted!-COVID-19: In theory, if the pandemic worsens, the kitchen could be shut down temporarily if there is a mass stay at home order. We don't anticipate this and can always revert back to cooking at home, but it is an unknown factor that all U.S. businesses are dealing with. If in the end we're unable to raise the funds we need, our project will be canceled and you'll get a full refund.Exceeding our goal will help us to produce a larger first run and introduce more exciting functioning pantry staples in the near future but we can't do it without you!Every amount of support counts, big or small. We hope you decide to come on this journey with us to create more magic in the world!\n"
